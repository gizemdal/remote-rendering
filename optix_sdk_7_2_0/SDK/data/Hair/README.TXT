The hair model file for this SDK sample are from Cem Yuksel's web page:

    www.cemyuksel.com/research/hairmodels

You can download three additional .hair definitions from there to be used
by the sample code. Other hair files than the default can be passed to
the executable via its "--hair" command-line parameter.
